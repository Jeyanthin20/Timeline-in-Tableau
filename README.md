Timeline created for superstore- united states dataset. 
Circle timeline based on sales by month.
I am going to put the order date in columns and make it as continuous month.
Sales on to the size shelf and change from automatic to circle.
Double click in the row shelf and pug avg(0}and click on avg (0) hide title.
And measure the profit in the color shelf & split up the value by region by putting it into rows.
We can format the circle size by changing the size of the circle.
